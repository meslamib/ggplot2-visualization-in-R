# From the previous exercise
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +

# 1 - Map cyl to fill

# 2 - Change shape and alpha of the points in the above plot

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, fill = cyl)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, alpha = 0.6, size = 4)

# 3 - Map am to col in the above plot

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, fill = cyl, col = am)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, alpha = 0.6, size = 4)
