# Variables in a data frame are mapped to aesthetics in aes(). (e.g. aes(col = cyl)) within ggplot(). Visual elements are set by attributes in specific geom layers 


# Expand to draw points with alpha 0.5
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, fill = cyl)) + geom_point(alpha=0.5)

  
# Expand to draw points with shape 24 and color yellow
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, fill = cyl)) + geom_point(shape=24, col='yellow')

  
# Expand to draw text with label rownames(mtcars) and color red
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, fill = cyl)) + geom_text(label=rownames(mtcars), col='red')
